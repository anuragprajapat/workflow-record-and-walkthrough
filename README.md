## workflow-record-and-walkthrough (React)

```workflow-record-and-walkthrough``` is a zero coding/config workflow creation and tour for products

## Zero coding/config involved (UI Driven)
And the best part.... There is **zero coding involved**

## How to Use

1) ```npm install workflow-record-and-walkthrough```
2) Create workflow using the record functionality.
3) users can see the workflow you created and play on it to start a UI Guide and guide them step by step through the entire process.
4) Done. :)
