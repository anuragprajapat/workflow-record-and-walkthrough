## workflow-record-and-walkthrough (React)

```workflow-record-and-walkthrough``` is a zero coding/config workflow creation and tour for products

## Zero coding/config involved (UI Driven)
And the best part.... There is **zero coding involved**
Forget diving into code and creating unmanagable config files. Use our workflow recorder feature to do everything with the UI

## How to Use

1) ```npm install workflow-record-and-walkthrough```
2) add this in App.js ```<SelfHelp themeColor="#FFC45E" highlightColor="#FFC45E" inspectorColor="#c1f0f6"></SelfHelp>```
3) Create workflow using the record functionality.
4) users can see the workflow you created and play on it to start a UI Guide and guide them step by step through the entire process.
5) Done. :)
